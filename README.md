[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/300517389.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/300517389)

This repository contains sample OpenFOAM simulation cases used in the work of [1]. The repository describes the step-by-step procedure to run a successful LES for evaluating wind loads on tall buildings. For The inflow boundary condition used for the simulations is based on the DFSR [2] method. The technique uses the spectral representation method to generate ABL-like turbulence with prescribed two-point flow statistics. The code is developed as a utility application using OpenFOAM's framework. DFSR  offers the following key features:
