# Wind Load Simulation on a Tall Building using LES

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/300517389.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/300517389)

This repository contains sample OpenFOAM simulation cases used in the work of [1]. The repository describes the step-by-step procedure to run a successful LES for evaluating wind loads on tall buildings. For The aproaching ABL flow is generated using the DFSR method.
